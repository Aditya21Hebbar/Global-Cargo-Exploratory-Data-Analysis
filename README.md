## What and Why Exploratory Data Analysis?
Exploratory data analysis(EDA) is used by data analysts/ Scientists to analyze  and investigate data and datasets and summarize thier main features, often employing data visualization methods. It helps in understanding the dataset very easily. Helps in manipulating data for further use.

  EDA is basically used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modelling or hypothesis testing task and provides better understanding of data set variables and the relationship between them. Originally developed by American mathematician Jhon Tukey in the 1970s, EDA techniques continue to be a widely used method in the data discovery process today.
  
  EDA can help us deliver great business results, by improving our existing knowledge and can also help in giving out new insights that we might not be aware of

# About the Project

In this project, we are trying to analyse Global Cargo Data. This selected dataset covers import and export volumes for 5.000 commodities across most countries on Earth over the last 30 years. 
     Personally i find commodities quite interesting because it helps to analyze not only about income of country but also international behaviours and relations of countries.
